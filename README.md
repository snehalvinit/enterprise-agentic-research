# Enterprise Agentic Research

Parallel research initiatives for upgrading Smart-Segmentation into an enterprise-grade agentic customer segmentation system.

## Research Attempts

| # | Folder | Model/Agent | Status | Description |
|---|--------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | `research_1_sonnet_claude/` | Sonnet Claude | Ready to Run | Enterprise agent architecture upgrade research |
| 2 | `research_1_opus_claude/` | Opus Claude 4.6 | Complete | 41 bottlenecks, 40+ sources, 5-layer architecture, 16-week roadmap |

## Structure

Each research attempt follows this structure:
```
research_X_<name>/
  PROMPT.txt                    # The organized prompt used for this research
  INDEX.md                      # Overview and links to all deliverables
  01_bottleneck_analysis.md     # Current codebase issues and bottlenecks
  02_research_compendium.md     # All research sources, summaries, citations
  03_concrete_upgrade_proposal.md  # Detailed upgrade plan with examples
  04_implementation_roadmap.md  # Prioritized step-by-step implementation plan
```

## How to Run a New Research

1. Copy `research_1_sonnet_claude/PROMPT.txt` as a template
2. Create a new folder: `research_<N>_<name>/`
3. Update the PROMPT.txt with any changes
4. Run the research with the chosen model/agent
5. Update this README with the new entry
