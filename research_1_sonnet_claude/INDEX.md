## Document Descriptions

### 01 — Bottleneck Analysis
All issues with the current Smart-Segmentation approach: architecture flaws, prompt design problems, eval gaps, scalability limits, reliability issues, and missing capabilities.

### 02 — Research Compendium
Deep research across academic papers, industry blogs, tweets, substacks, and frameworks. Each source includes a summary, what's useful, and how it applies to enterprise agent goals. All citations with URLs.

### 03 — Concrete Upgrade Proposal
Detailed reformation plan starting from high-level architecture, drilling into component details, then specific transformation examples. State-of-the-art approaches weighted against cost-based alternatives.

### 04 — Implementation Roadmap
Prioritized step-by-step plan identifying parallelizable tracks, dependencies, risks, and the reasoning behind each priority decision. Most impactful work first.
